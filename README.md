## Data modeling with PostgreSQL and Apache Cassandra

This repo contains two folders with projects I completed as part of the Udacity Data Engineering programme: 
https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027

The projects were:

1. <b>Data modeling with PostgreSQL</b>: transform raw json data to a relational database schema (has its own README)
2. <b>Data modeling with Apache Cassandra</b>: one-table-per-query, NoSQL data modeling (detailed description in the project notebook)

If you're a Udacity student enrolled in this programme: hey, plagiarism is bad! Don't look at the code before your own submissions pass the review. The Knowledge space there is actually quite helpful. =)
